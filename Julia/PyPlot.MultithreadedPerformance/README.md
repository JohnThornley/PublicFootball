# PyPlot.MultithreadedPerformance

Plots produced by scripts in Script.PyPlot.MultithreadedPerformance.
Measurements were run on a 12-core AMD Ryzen 5900X system with 64GB 3600MHz DDR4 RAM
and with SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading - AMD's equivalent to Intel's hyperthreading) disabled.

Note: Plots are 300 DPI, therefore large.
