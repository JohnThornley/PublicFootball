# Julia

Julia code for bivariate Poission model and data analysis and the resulting plots.
Also, a script and plot from some initial experimentation (not related to football analysis) with multithreaded performance speedups.

### Folders:

- **Lib** - bivariate Poisson model and related utilities

- **Script.PyPlot.BivariatePoissonPaper** - scripts for plotting (via PyPlot) bivariate Poisson and football goal scoring analysis
- **PyPlot.BivariatePoissonPaper** -- plots produced by scripts in **Script.PyPlot.BivariatePoissonPaper**

- **Script.NotPlot** - scripts for data calculation and persistence

- **Script.MultithreadedPerformance** - scripts for experimenting with multithreaded execution speedups
- **PyPlot.MultithreadedPerformance** - plots produced by scripts in **Script.MultithreadedPerformance**
